**Enhancing Pneumonia Classification in Chest X-ray Images using Data Augmentation and Deep Learning**
---
**Project Overview**
---
This project aims to enhance the classification accuracy of chest X-ray images for detecting pneumonia using advanced deep learning techniques. We utilized a combination of data augmentation methods and a pre-trained deep learning model to improve robustness and generalization. Data augmentation included transformations such as horizontal flipping, rotation, zooming, and color adjustments to increase the diversity of training images and mitigate overfitting.

**Approach**
--
Developed a deep learning model leveraging the pre-trained Xception architecture, known for its superior performance in image classification tasks. The model architecture was designed to be computationally efficient and interpretable, consisting of a simple classifier with no hidden layers. The training process utilized 5,000 data points and 4,000 parameters to balance complexity and performance. Comprehensive evaluation was conducted using a custom data generator on Google Colab to assess the modelâ€™s effectiveness in a cloud-based environment.

**Evaulation**
--
Initial results showed high training accuracy but lower performance on the validation set, with test accuracy around 77%. This indicates possible overfitting, model complexity issues, or data imbalance. Adjustments, such as tuning the learning rate, modifying the number of epochs, and implementing additional data balancing strategies, are required to enhance model performance.

The project highlighted the effectiveness of using data augmentation and pre-trained models in enhancing the classification of chest X-ray images. Despite achieving high accuracy in training, attention must be given to improving validation and test performance. Future work will focus on addressing the identified issues and exploring additional techniques to enhance model robustness and generalization.
