# ParaK8s

ParaK8s is a framework designed to **organize and manage very large collections of machine learning experiments** over a **multi-node Kubernetes cluster**. It simplifies experiment orchestration, tracking, and resource allocation, allowing researchers and ML engineers to scale their workflows efficiently.

## Features

- **Multi-node orchestration**: Run hundreds or thousands of experiments across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.  
- **Experiment organization**: Automatically manages experiment configurations, logs, checkpoints, and metadata.  
- **Resource-aware scheduling**: Allocates GPU, CPU, and memory efficiently across experiments.  
- **Experiment reproducibility**: Tracks hyperparameters, datasets, and code versions to ensure experiments are reproducible.  
- **Seamless ML framework integration**: Works with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other major ML libraries.  
- **Scalable logging and monitoring**: Collects experiment metrics and logs centrally for easier analysis.
