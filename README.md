Our team decided to tackle a healthcare-related project by selecting a dataset from Kaggle that consisted of chest X-ray images. Our aim was to develop an image classifier specifically designed to identify pneumonia from these X-rays. Pneumonia, an inflammatory condition of the lungs caused by various pathogens, was the target for classification in our study. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, processed the data accordingly, and proceeded to build a logistic regression model for our analysis.

Project Overview
The dataset we used from Kaggle was a collection of chest X-ray scans. Our initial goal was to train a machine learning model to correctly categorize these photos as pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative using logistic regression.

Approach
Dataset Handling: The dataset was divided into two main subsets:
Training Set: Used to train our logistic regression model. 
Testing Set: Used for evaluating the model's performance
Model Development: We processed the data to ensure that it was appropriate for training. Our primary focus was on creating a logistic regression model because of its simplicity and interpretability, which are critical in medical settings.
Evaluation:
Data_1 AUC = 0.73: An Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.73 from our preliminary analysis indicated a moderate level of predictive ability. This implies that the model has potential for differentiating between cases that have pneumonia and those that do not.
Data_2 AUC = 0.94: An AUC of 0.94 in the subsequent study indicated a considerable improvement. This suggests a strong capacity to distinguish between those that have pneumonia and those that do not.
Data_3 AUC = 0.74. An further test of the dataset produced an AUC of 0.74, confirming the model's reliable performance across various data splits. This consistency shows that, despite changes in the dataset, the model's performance is consistent and dependable.

Team Dynamics and Collaboration
Our team consisted of members who collaborated to tackle a healthcare-related project focused on pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images from Kaggle. Throughout the project, we emphasized effective communication and coordinated efforts to achieve our goals.We followed an organized set of engagement principles known as Five High5, which effectively led our collaboration and communication over the project. These rules included emphasizing presence, assuming positive intent, owning our voices during meetings, proposing problem-solving solutions, and viewing mistakes as learning opportunities. By adhering to these rules, we created a collaborative environment conducive to our goal of constructing a logistic regression model for pneumonia classification.

Approach and Execution
We began the study by having two dataset: training and testing sets, prepping it for analysis, and developing a logistic regression model for pneumonia classification.

Conclusion
Finally, our project attempted to use machine learning approaches to automate pneumonia detection using image analysis. We hoped to contribute to the advancement of healthcare technology by focusing on logistic regression and employing a curated dataset for medical picture categorization.
